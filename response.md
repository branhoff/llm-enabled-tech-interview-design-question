Did you consider using GPT4V for data extraction vs OCR?
- In considering the best approach for data extraction from catalog images, my decision was influenced by a focus on cost-effectiveness. To align with this, I recommended leveraging computing resources on a pay-as-you-go pricing model, as it offers flexibility and scalability while minimizing initial costs. Although GPT-4V presents an intriguing option, the recommendation was guided by the objective of cost savings.

Which solution would you recommend?
- My recommendation hinges on a comprehensive understanding of the project's budget constraints and the comparative effectiveness of GPT-4V versus Tesseract OCR in meeting our objectives. We would need to understand the scale of image processing required, as GPT-4V, while potentially offering advanced capabilities, may be cost prohibitive. If budgetary limitations are a concern and the volume of images to be processed is substantial, the strategy outlined in my document, focusing on cost-effective OCR technology complemented by a scalable cloud infrastructure, may be the most suitable approach.

Can you estimate the high-level effort and steps it would take you to create the first POC?

1. Project Planning and Requirements Gathering:
   - Define the project scope, identify specific requirements for the POC, and establish metrics for success. This includes understanding the volume of images and the types of queries the system needs to handle.

2. Selection and Setup of Technology Stack:
   - Choose appropriate technologies based on the cost-effectiveness and scalability criteria. If GPT4V is cost prohibitive, this would involve setting up a cloud computing environment with a pay-as-you-go model and selecting Tesseract OCR for text extraction from catalog images.

3. Development of OCR Processing Pipeline:
   - Implement the OCR pipeline to convert catalog images into searchable text. This step includes configuring Tesseract OCR, processing a set of sample images, and optimizing for accuracy.

4. Text Indexing and Search Capability Setup:
   - Deploy Elasticsearch or a similar open-source text indexing service. Index the text extracted by the OCR process and set up basic search functionalities to test the retrieval of part diagrams and numbers.

5. User Interface (UI) Development for Query Input:
   - Design and develop a simple yet functional UI that allows internal staff to input queries. This phase should focus on usability and the ability to effectively test the systemâ€™s response to queries.
